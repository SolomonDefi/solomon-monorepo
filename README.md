# Solomon Monorepo

This monorepo contains all the main apps and libraries used in the Solomon payments ecosystem. It relies on [Nx](https://nx.dev) for generating, running, building, and testing.

We recommend [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) over NPM for package management. In the following sections, we also make use of an `pnpx` alias, which can be added to your shell profile.

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
alias pnx="pnpm run nx --"
pnpm install
```

## Getting started

Follow these instructions to set up your local development environment. Only MacOs instructions are provided, but a similar process can be followed on other systems (replace Brew with local package manager).

**Global Dependencies**

1. **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)** - containerization Kubernetes cluster on your desktop.
   - :exclamation: **After install:** Enable local Kubernetes cluster in preferences per [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/#enable-kubernetes).
     It will take a few minutes to provision the cluster for the first time.
2. **[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)** - package manager for macOS.
3. **[NodeJs (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v14.x/api/index.html) and NPM** -
   Follow [NVM Wiki](https://github.com/SolomonDefi/solomon-monorepo/wiki/NVM) to install
   and select the correct Node/NPM versions
4. **[Helm](https://helm.sh/)** - The package manager for Kubernetes.

   ```sh
   $ brew install helm
   ```

5. **[Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/)** - build/deploy tool for local Kubernetes development.

   ```sh
   $ brew install skaffold
   ```

**Start local dev environment**

```sh
$ pnpm install
$ pnpm run skaffold
```

- It may take up to 10 minutes for skaffold to run for the first time. The subsequent runs
  should be much faster because artifacts are cached
- The skaffold run is usually finished when it a) settles (i.e. no more stuff is
  written to the terminal log) and b) you are able to verify responses from the
  apps in the next step.

**Run individual Dockerfiles**

It's possible to run apps individually, which can be useful if you're verifying package changes or debugging docker syntax:

```
docker build --progress=plain --no-cache -t blockchain-watcher:dev -f apps/blockchain-watcher/Dockerfile --target=dev .
docker build --progress=plain --no-cache -t api-evidence:dev -f apps/api-evidence/Dockerfile --target=dev .
docker build --progress=plain --no-cache -t api-dispute:dev -f apps/api-dispute/Dockerfile --target=dev .
docker build --progress=plain --no-cache -t web-evidence:dev -f apps/web-evidence/Dockerfile --target=dev .
docker build --progress=plain --no-cache -t db-api -f apps/db-api/Dockerfile .
```

## Apps

The following table outlines all the apps available. Each app is located in `apps/<app-name>`, and `<app-name>` can be substituted in the next section to serve, build, or test specific apps.

| app-name           | Description                                                             |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| blockchain-watcher | Watches Solomon contracts and emails relevant parties when events occur |

### App Commands

**Serve (local development)**

```bash
pnpx nx serve <app-name>
```

**Build**

```bash
pnpx nx build <app-name>
```

**Test**

```bash
pnpx nx test <app-name>
```

### Solomon Evidence Uploader

- Frontend: `apps/web-evidence`
- Backend: `apps/api-evidence`
  - [Setup instructions](./apps/api-evidence)

The purpose of the uploader is to provide a simple interface for uploading evidence links to the blockchain during escrow disputes. Links must exist for the duration of the dispute (generally a maximum of 2 months). There are several methods for uploading evidence, and it is straightforward to add more.

1. User provides their own link
2. User provides files and the `backend` uploads to an S3-compatible data store
3. (TBD) Pin on an IPFS node for the duration of a dispute

Currently, only Metamask is supported as a wallet provider for posting the link to the blockchain, but WalletConnect and other methods may be added in the future.

A hosted frontend and backend will be provided by Solomon, based on this repository.

### Commit message

The commit message format is: `<scope> [<project>]: <short-summary> #<issue-number>`

- `scope`: Follow the [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) rule
- `project`: One of `web`, `api`, `blockchain`, `docs` and `root`
- `short-summary`: Short summary about this commit
- `issue-number`: The related issue number

All commit message header sections are required, and enforced by [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky).
You can check the validator [here](/tools/scripts/checkCommitMsg.ts).

The following are `gitmoji` recommendations for the `scope`. These are not currently enforced, but may be in the future.
