# Theming

Both the Plugin and Shopping Cart include default themes that are fully customizable. When using with a bundler (such as Rollup, Webpack,
etc), you may plug directly in to our [Postcss](https://postcss.org/) processing pipeline. Otherwise, it is easy enough to simply override
css classes.
