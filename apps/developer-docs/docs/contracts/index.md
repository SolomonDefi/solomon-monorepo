## Contribution

SLM purchase contracts are written in Solidity. We use [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for development, and future packages will be pushed
to NPM. For now, contracts are included by adding a git tag to dependencies, and importing directly from `node_modules/`

**Install** (we recommend [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/) if you work with many node projects):
```
npm install
```

**Compile**
```
npx hardhat compile
```

**Test**
```
npx hardhat test
```
