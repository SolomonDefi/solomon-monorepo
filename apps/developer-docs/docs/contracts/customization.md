# Customization

Solomon Chargebacks, Preorder, and Escrow contracts can be customized by passing in options to the factory constructor. Normally this is
handled directly by the frontend plugin, but apps with e.g. existing backend shopping functionality can integrate directly with the
blockchain.

See the contract [API documentation](/contracts/api) for precise, code generated definitions.
