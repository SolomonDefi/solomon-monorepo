# Technology

Solomon takes advantage an accessible and modern tech stack in order to iterate quickly and encourage community contributions.

## Ethereum

Solomon's core technology is built around Ethereum, which is still the gold standard for smart contract development, with the best
documentation and mature development practices. Solidity is the most widely used language for the Ethereum virtual machine

## Frontend

Aside from blockchain contracts guaranteeing buyer protection for online transactions, Solomon's core strength is it's extensible frontend
plugin. Using popular, modern, and light frameworks and development practices is key for growing a developer community and having the best
chance of avoiding future tech stack obsolescence.

### Vue3

[Vue3](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next) is a significant upgrade over Vue2, which is one of the most popular javascript frameworks. It enables more convenient typescript
integration, a composition API for better code organization and reuse, native Postcss integration, and numerous speed/build size
improvements.

Solomon's plugin is built as a Vue3 component, although we provide builds that work natively in the browser and other populate frameworks.

### Vite

[Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) is an extremely fast and convenient development server built by the creator of Vue. It integrates
cleanly with Vue3, and removes a lot of the headache and bloat of Webpack.

### VitePress

[VitePress](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress) is a fast static site generator geared towards building documentation sites.

This site is built on VitePress.

## Services

For the various services surrounding the smart contracts and frontend plugin, Solomon evaluates requirements and tech options, and attempts
to choose the best one for the job.

### Rust

Solomon uses Rust when possible to take advantage of it's speed and safety.

### Python

We often use Python when speed and safety are less important than ecosystem and ease of development.

### Node

We use Node for similar reasons as Python.
